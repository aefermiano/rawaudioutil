# rawaudioutil

Very simple tool that converts CDDA raw audio to WAVE (and the opposite), receiving data from stdin and writing to stdout.

Built to use with gdc-compressor.

## Usage

Raw to wav:
```
cat <raw file> | rawaudioutil --raw2wav <raw file size> > <wav file>
```

Wav to raw:

```
cat <wav file> | rawaudioutil --wav2raw 0 > <raw file>
```

## Building

```
cmake .
make
sudo make install
```
